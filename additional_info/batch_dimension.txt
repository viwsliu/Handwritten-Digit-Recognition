Batch Dimensions in PyTorch:

- PyTorch expects image input in the shape: [Batch Size, Channels, Height, Width]
- Batch Size: number of samples processed at once
- Channels: 1 for grayscale, 3 for RGB
- Height and Width: pixel dimensions of the image

Examples:
- A single 28x28 grayscale image tensor is shaped [1, 28, 28]
- After adding batch dimension: [1, 1, 28, 28]

Adding a batch dimension:
- Use .unsqueeze(0) to add a batch dimension at the front

Why it's needed:
- Neural networks are designed to process batches, even if the batch contains only 1 item
